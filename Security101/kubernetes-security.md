# Kubernetes Security

As individual developers, security is probably not something that is at the forefront of our minds. We focus mostly on fulfilling the requirements of a task and leave things like access control to be handled later. When it comes to working with Kubernetes, we tend to take the security aspect of things for granted. Since Kubernetes is built with security in mind, and since the authors of any emerging technologies need to give security its due care for the technology to be considered for commercial use, the Kubernetes ecosystem is relatively secure. However, when it comes to large organizations that set up large-scale clusters for internal and customer use, it is very important to have a significant amount of security measures in place. In fact, most large organizations have entire teams dedicated to handling authorization and application security. Kubernetes depends on microservices, which use thousands of third-party applications to function. Each of these applications could potentially introduce a security vulnerability, and that is simply not acceptable. A breach that occurs for a client due to mishandled credentials could cost greatly for a business, and it is therefore in an organization's interest to ensure that they hire DevOps engineers that know security best practices. So let's take a deep dive into Kubernetes security.

## Securing images

When using third-party images, there is a possibility that the author of the image may not have taken the necessary steps to secure the image. Therefore, ensuring that images comply with the security standard set by your organization is up to you. However, if you are creating your own image to be used internally or to be freely available on an image hosting site, there are several steps you should take to secure your image. After all, it would be rather embarrassing if an attacker managed to gain access to a cluster by exploiting a container running your image. So what can be done here? 

### Check your dependencies
Unless the image you are building only does a simple task, you would likely use a base image or a list of images that your image depends on. You would then build your image on top of this base image. This is one place where things can go wrong since you have little control over the base images and their content. Additionally, you may have images that interact with the underlying operating system and performs some commands that allow attackers to see a backdoor in the system. The easiest way to circumvent this issue is to use as few dependencies as possible. The more images you depend on, the greater the chance of a security risk. When choosing a dependency, make sure you only get an image that has exactly what you want. For instance, if you want to curl, then there is no reason to choose a general-purpose image that has curl/wget/other request handling commands instead of just getting an image that provides curl.

**Image scanning**: You might think that all the above steps sound complicated, but they shouldn't be, because image scanning exists. Image scanning allows you to automatically look at a database of regularly updated vulnerabilities and compare your image and its dependencies against it. Normally, you wouldn't build a commercial-grade image by hand, and would instead allow a pipeline to do that for you. You could simply add image scanning as an additional step that runs after the image itself has been built.

But vulnerabilities can be added after the image has been built, and if your image depends on other images, vulnerabilities can be introduced via those other images as well. The result of this is that you can't afford to scan your image once, push it into the container repo, and forget about it. You need to ensure that all the images that already exist in your registry are periodically scanned. You might have some help in this regard depending on the image registry you choose. For instance, registries such as GCR, AWS ECR, Docker hub, etc... have inbuilt repository image scanning capabilities. However, if you host your own container registry, then you might need to do this manually.

### User Service users

If you run your containers with users that have unrestricted access (such as a root user), then an attacker who gains access to your container can easily gain access to the host system since they already have elevated privileges. The solution to this problem is to create a service user when creating the container, and then to ensure that the container is handled by that un-privileged service user.  This way, even if an attacker gets access to the container, they won't be able to do much with the service account and would have to also get access to the root user before they can accomplish anything.

### Maintain tight user groups and permissions

All the above precautions need to be taken when creating the image, well before it is deployed. However, these are just the first steps. Once you actually go ahead and deploy your images and have pods spun up from them, there are further actions that you need to take to prevent attackers from hacking into your system. It is a common conception that the users of a system are its weakest link, and while users need to be able to use the system in a way that doesn't allow it to be exploited, your job is to assume that an exploit will happen and to prepare accordingly. Note that your cluster may be accessed by accounts belonging to real people as well as automated system/service accounts. All these accounts need to be secured. If you give every single user in the organization admin privileges, then if just one of those accounts were to be compromised, your entire system will be at risk. Alternatively, if each user is grouped to a very specific set of permissions that allow the user to do only what they need to, and nothing more, then even if an account is compromised, the damage would be limited.
