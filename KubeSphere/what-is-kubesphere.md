# Kubesphere

As a Kubernetes engineer, you likely have little trouble navigating around a Kubernetes cluster. Setting up resources, observing pod logs, and troubleshooting root causes of errors, are all part of your daily work. However, what happens when someone who does not have a deep understanding of Kubernetes needs to do these things? For example, a project manager or a QA engineer might very well want to check out the reason why a pod failed so they can create a report about it. Tools such as Kube Lens exist to help with this observation without having to write any kubectl commands, but setting up Kube Lens is itself a process that a non-Kubernetes user may find difficult. It is necessary to install tools such as kubectl, set up the kubeconfigs, etc... What if things could be simpler, where anyone could just log into a dashboard and have access to everything with a few clicks?

This is exactly what Kubesphere offers. A fully consolidated Kubernetes management system, with additional support for plugins that easily let you integrate your cluster with external applications.
