## Lab

For starters, we will be using the files we created in the [Terraform section](../Terraform101/terraform-eks-lab.md) to set up our VPC, subnet, and ultimately, our cluster. So go ahead and take those files and use them to create the cluster. Once the cluster is up, take the files from the [ArgoCD section](../GitOps101/argocd-eks.md), and deploy them. The first time around, you will have to either deploy the files manually, or use CLI commands to add the repos, create the project, add the cluster created by Terraform, and finally set up the application. As you may have noticed, this is rather time consuming and not ideal in a DR situation. But the good news is that once your ArgoCD application is up, there is no reason to spend any time setting up the application all over again.
