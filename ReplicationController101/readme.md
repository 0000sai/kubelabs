# Replication Controller
- A Replication Controller ensure that a specified number of replicas (identical copies) of a pod are running at all times.
- If there are too few replicas, the Replication Controller creates additional ones; if there are too many, it terminates the excess pods.
- Replication Controllers use label selectors to identify the pods they manage. This allows for flexibility in specifying which pods should be part of a particular set. Labels are key-value pairs attached to pods, and selectors are used to filter and group pods based on these labels.
