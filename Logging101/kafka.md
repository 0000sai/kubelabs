# What is Apache Kafka?

Event-driven architecture is the basis of what most modern applications follow. This section is on logging, and it is a perfect example of what event-driven architecture is. When an event happens, some other event occurs. In the case of logging, when an event happens, information about what just happened is logged in. The event in question usually involves some sort of data transfer from one data source to another, and while this may be easy to grasp and understand when the application is small or there are only a handful of data streams, it gets complicated and unmanageable very quickly once the amount of data in your system increases. This is where Apache Kafka comes in. 

If you think about it, you could even say that logs were an alternative to data stored in a database. After all, at the end of the day, everything is just data. The difference is that with databases, it is very hard to scale up and is not an ideal tool to handle data streams. Logs, on the other hand, are. Logs can also be distributed across multiple systems (by duplication) so there are no single points of failure. Unlike database records, logs are unstructured and there is nothing governing what the data should be like. You could have small data logs or relatively larger data logs. Data logs can be stored for a small amount of time, or logs can be stored indefinitely. Kafka supports all of these situations.

A microservice is a small component that does only one or a small handful of functionalities that you can logically group into your head. In a complicated system, there would be hundreds of such microservices working in tandem to do all sorts of things. As you can imagine, this is an excellent place for logging to be used.
