# What is Apache Kafka?

Event-driven architecture is the basis of what most modern applications follow. This section is on logging, and it is a perfect example of what event-driven architecture is. When an event happens, some other event occurs. In the case of logging, when an event happens, information about what just happened is logged in. The event in question usually involves some sort of data transfer from one data source to another, and while this may be easy to grasp and understand when the application is small or there are only a handful of data streams, it gets complicated and unmanageable very quickly once the amount of data in your system increases. This is where Apache Kafka comes in. 

If you think about it, you could even say that logs were an alternative to data stored in a database. After all, at the end of the day, everything is just data. The difference is that with databases, it is very hard to scale up and is not an ideal tool to handle data streams. Logs, on the other hand, are. Logs can also be distributed across multiple systems (by duplication) so there is no single point of failure. This is especially useful in the case of microservices. A microservice is a small component that does only one or a small handful of functionalities that you can logically group into your head. In a complicated system, there would be hundreds of such microservices working in tandem to do all sorts of things. As you can imagine, this is an excellent place for logging to be used. One microservice may handle authentication, and it does so by running the user through a series of steps. At each step, there is a log produced. Now, it would make little sense if the logs were jumbled and disorderly. Logs **must** maintain order for them to be useful. For this, Kafka introduces topics.

## Kafka topics

A topic is simply an ordered list of events. Unlike database records, logs are unstructured and there is nothing governing what the data should be like. You could have small data logs or relatively larger data logs. Data logs can be stored for a small amount of time, or logs can be stored indefinitely. Kafka topics exist to support all of these situations. What's interesting is that topics aren't write-only. While microservices may log their events in a Kafka topic, they can also read logs from a topic. This is useful in cases where a microservice may hold information that a different microservice must consume. The output can then be piped into yet another Kafka topic where it can be processed separately. 

Topics aren't static and can be considered to be a stream of data. This means that topics are being expanded as new events get added in. If you consider a large system, there may be hundreds of such topics that maintain logs for all sorts of events in real-time. I think you can already see how real-time data being appended into a continuous stream can be a gold mine for data scientists or engineers looking to perform analysis and gain insights from the data. So, this naturally means that entire services can be introduced simply to process or simply to visualize and display this data.

## Kafka Connect

While Kafka was initially released in 2011, it really started gaining popularity in recent years. This means that many large businesses which already had large quantities of data and processes on how the data was handled would have a hard time switching to Kafka. Additionally, some parts of the system may never be converted to Kafka at all. Kafka connect exists to support these kinds of situations.
