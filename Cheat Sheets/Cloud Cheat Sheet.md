# Cloud cheatsheet

There are several cloud providers out there, with Azure, AWS, and GCP dominating the market share. Each of these cloud providers has a fully managed Kubernetes platform that you can use to spin up a cluster within seconds without worrying about the infrastructure. They also handle the security, scaling, and other aspects that make them superior choices over self-managed clusters. While each cloud service has different commands, all of them run under the same concepts. So here, we will be discussing the various commands that are important to keep in memory for each of the three cloud providers.

Note that most of the commands for these cloud providers can get quite complex, and it is unlikely that you will be expected to keep every command and every parameter in memory. Instead, the general format of the command is what you should try to remember. Also note that all three of these providers (as well as other providers) have a user-friendly console which you can use to perform operations on your cluster (as well as other cloud resources), so be sure to take advantage of that.
